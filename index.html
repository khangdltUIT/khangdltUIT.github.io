    <p><font face = Lora, size = 4>The reason why I create this blog is to share my experience about my life, my books, my opinion and my study, especially Computer Vision.</font></p>
    <p><font face = Lora, size = 4>Furthermore, I also review some books that I have recently read. </font></p>
    <p><font face = Lora, size = 4>Most of my technical work is on GitHub. These are some projects that I did at University:</font></p>

        <a href="https://github.com/kangdoung/CS114.K21/blob/master/Do_an_cuoi_ky/Classify_face_celeb_svc_and_cnn.ipynb"> 1. Classify faces in 5 celebrity faces: </a> We built a dataset including the faces of 4 celebrities in Vietnam. 
        The size of the dataset is 1500 images with 300 images for each class. 
        Additionally, we use some machine learning models to classify classes. 
        Regarding feature extracting, we use HOG and a deep learning model called Face-recognition as a feature extractor. Then, we compared 2 results and gave a summary of two methods in conclusion. 
        More details could be found at this Github.</font></p>
