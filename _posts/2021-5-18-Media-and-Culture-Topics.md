Hi everyone! There are some topics that I created through the progress when I learn English for IELTS.
# Part 1

# Part 2
1. Describe your a piece of good news 
* Recap:
    * You should say:
        * When I got this news?
        * Where they got this news from?
        * Explain why you think it was a good piece of news?
* My topic:
    Well, I would like to share with you the news that I heard some days ago which is about the appearance of vaccines COVID19. To be honest, I think it is an official notification because I heard it from the television program on the VTV3 channel which is a national channel in Vietnam. Well, I think this notification is good not only for me but also for humans all around the world. 
    First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic leads to many problems from health to economics. So, the appearance of COVID19 is the solution for all of that. 
    Furthermore, this pandemic affect me about my plan for study abroud, look for job and go to conferences. Now, with vaccine, I could do everthing that I planned.
    In short, I think those are reasons why it is a good piece of news.
