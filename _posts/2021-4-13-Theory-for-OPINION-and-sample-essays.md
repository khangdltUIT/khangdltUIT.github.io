# 4. Sample topics:

1. Financial should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extend do you *agree or disagree* with this statement?

There are various perspecties on the question of whether or not financial should be taught in the school. I concure with the idea that adding this subject in curriculum is beneficial due to following reasons.  

***It is undeniable that financial literacy provides student with many life skills including avoidance of swindle and investment.*** (Câu mở đoạn paragraph -> nêu lí do/ lợi ích/ kết quả => Sau đó giải thích) Initially, due to lacking knowledge and experience in transaction, many adults were defrauded by criminals. For instance, customers of some banks were swindled out of thousands of dollars when they revealed their passwords in the bank website. In addition, after learning monetery management in school, many teenagers are able to establish their own business, namely lemonade stands or school supplies stores, *thus earning money to support themselves and creating foundation for future success.*  

Besides, young learners understanding finance tend to treasure labor and property. As the econoy thrives, numerous children and young adults from affluent families, who are indulged with foods and toys, often squander money on video-games, bars and extravagant outfits. If they were taught financy at early age, they would be less likely to spend money on such frivolous pastimes. Futhermore, financially literate students often understand that their parents have to work assiduously to make money; therefore, they **have a tendency to** save money and take responsibility for their belongings more than peer friends.  

In conlusion, it is advisable to make financial eduction an obligatory component of the school program. This preparation is a cornerstone for students'future achievements. 

2. Nowadays university education is very expensive. Some people say that universities should reduce their fees, especially for the less fortunate students or those coming from rural areas. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

The idea that universities should decrease their fees for students who come from rural areas or have less fortunate has become a source of controversy. While I accepted that the universities should reduce their fees, the downsides of this statement can not be overlooked.

It is undeniable that high payments for studying at the university caused a lot of trouble for people who want to get more knowledge. Initially, due to lacking high advanced workers who graduated from universities, many positions in companies that require advanced knowledge are difficult to recruit. Also, a big cost for learning causes the social imbalance with risk people could access to university and the other people could not. Therefore, decreasing tuition fees could help everyone who desires to continue to have more knowledge access to the university education.

In the other hand, the declining university cost causes many problems. Firstly, the cheap tuition makes students not strive their best to learn. The reason is that they could pay another cost to re-study. Also, decreasing fees for less fortunate students or coming from rural areas could make other students feel unfairly treated. Instead, universities could grant scholarships for students who have more effort in the term or a loan to study.

In conclusion, through decreasing tuition is crucial to students for some upsides, it seems inappropriate to them considering its difficulty and negative impact.
